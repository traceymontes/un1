        <h2>Welcome to the United Nations</h2>
        <p>The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization whose stated purposes are to maintain international 
            peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation, and serve as a 
            centre for harmonizing the actions of nations.</p>
        <p>The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future world wars, and succeeded the League of 
            Nations, which was characterized as ineffective. On 25 April 1945, 50 nat. The organization's mission to preserve world 
            peace was complicated in its early decades due in part to Cold War tensions that existed between the United States and 
            Soviet Union and their respective allies. Its mission has included the provision of primarily unarmed military observers 
            and lightly armed troops charged with primarily monitoring, reporting and confidence-building roles.</p>
            
        <p>UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s. Since then, 80 former colonies have gained independence, 
            including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council. By the 1970s, the UN's budget for 
            economic and social development programmes vastly exceeded its spending on peacekeeping.</p> 

        <p>Four months after the San Francisco Conference ended, the United Nations officially began, on 24 October 1945, when it came into existence 
            after its Charter had been ratified by China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and by a majority of other signatories.
            Now, more than 75 years later, the United Nations is still working to maintain international peace and security, give humanitarian assistance to those 
            in need, protect human rights, and uphold international law.</p>

        <p>At the same time, the United Nations is doing new work not envisioned for it in 1945 by its founders. The United Nations has set sustainable development 
            goals for 2030, in order to achieve a better and more sustainable future for us all. UN Member States have also agreed to climate action to limit global 
            warming. With many achievements now in its past, the United Nations is looking to the future, to new achievements.</p>
            
        <p>The history of the United Nations is still being written.</p>
